# my-portfolio
 My first portfolio website. It is a straightforward site where I have posted all my current web development projects. The website is responsive, clear and aesthetic. 

I will pursue a career in Web Development through self-education and something known in Germany as an "Ausbildung". This is my presentation card for any potential employer.
